# Data Preparation

Prior to filing an H-1B petition with the USCIS, an employer must file an LCA with the DOL. An LCA is used by employers as supporting evidence for the petition for an H-1B visa. All data is from the US government.

I decided to look at the data for these big tech companies and their subsidiaries:

- Facebook
  - Facebook Inc
  - Facebook Miami Inc
  - Facebook Payments Inc
  - WhatsApp Inc
- Amazon
  - Amazon Web Services Inc
  - Amazon Development Center US Inc
  - Amazon Data Services Inc
  - Amazon Robotics LLC
  - Amazon Advertising LLC
  - Amazon Mechanical Turk Inc
  - Amazon Payments Inc
  - Amazon Services LLC
  - Amazon Capital Services Inc
  - Amazon Registry Services Inc
  - Amazon Studios LLC
  - Amazon Dev Center US Inc
  - Amazon Development Center US Inc
  - Amazon Com Services LLC
  - Amazon Web Services Inc
  - Amazon Retail LLC
  - Amazon Web Service Inc
  - Amazon Digital Services LLC
- Apple Inc
- Netflix
  - Netflix Inc
  - Netflix Global LLC
- Google
  - Google LLC
  - Google Inc
- Microsoft
  - Microsoft Corporation
  - LinkedIn Corporation

Here's the data in a Microsoft Excel sheet. I put each company on its own sheet:

After gathering the data, I combined the different companies into a single sheet. Only Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google remained in the EMPLOYER column, all other subsidiaries were renamed to their respective companies. The final excel sheet contained around 101,000 rows.
