# Big-Tech-Compensation-Analysis

Almost every engineering student wants to work at Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, or Google. But why? After doing some research, I learned that compensation and reputation are the biggest factors. Sadly, websites like Salary.com, Glassdoor, and PayScale often have inaccurate compensation statistics because no data is verified. In this project, I analyzed verified United States H-1B Visa data from Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google learn more about compensation in big tech. Excel, JMP, and Tableau were used for this project.
